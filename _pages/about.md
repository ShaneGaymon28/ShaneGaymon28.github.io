Hello there, I'm Shane! I'm a recent graduate from Clemson University with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science with minors in Cybersecurity and Business Administration. 

In short, I have full-stack web development experience from my undergraduate studies and two summers as a Software Development intern at DataWorks Plus in Greenville, SC. My web development expertise lies mostly in Microsoft's ASP.NET framework with some experience working with NodeJS. The main programming languages in my tech stack are C#, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. I've managed everything from front end web page creation to building custom backend services for a company's needs. 

I'm a lifelong learner (currently working towards a few CompTIA certifications) and love to read, play golf, and enjoy the great outdoors! I'm interested in history and my current favorite book is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_Fire">Gates of Fire by Steven Pressfield</a>, a novel on the Battle of Thermopylae and the 300 Spartans who defended the gateway from the Persian Empire. My favorite shows include HBO's Game of Thrones / House of the Dragon and the Yellowstone series (1883 and 1923 also)!

Please feel free to contact me!
